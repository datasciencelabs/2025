## Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

-   Posit provides a free IDE for R with RStudio
-   those with more programming experience may want to experiment with Positron (newer and adapted to LLMs)
-   IDEs provide a framework for developing software, carrying out analyses and integrating code, with analysis
-   they can help with creating packages, documenting functions and using external tools such as `gitHub`

## The Basics

Let's try a few things together:

-   Open a new R script file.
-   Learn tab complete.
-   Run commands while editing scripts.
-   Run the entire script.
-   Make a plot.
-   Change options to never save workspace.
-   Change IDE appearance.

## Projects

Let's try this together:

-   Start new project in new directory.
-   Start new project in existing directory.
-   Change projects.
-   Use the `File` menu to create a new Quarto document

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Type of editor{.smaller}

- the editor you use will depend on what kind of document you are editing
- they can be customized in many ways and often have language specific settings
- we will be creating and editing markdown documents - mostly using the Quarto paradigm

- for Quarto you can use either a source view or a visual view:
    -   Source - See the actual code (WYSIWYG)
    -   Visual - Partial preview of final document.

Note: You can state your preference in a the header:

```yaml

editor: source
```

-   We learn more about Quarto soon
